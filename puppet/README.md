##Puppet
Puppet is configuration management system that allows you to define the state of your IT
infrastructure, then automatically enforce the correct state.

Puppet automates every step of the software delivery process: from provisioning of physical
and virtual machines to orchestration and reporting; from early-stage code development through
testing, production release and updates. Puppet ensures consistency, reliability and stability

To get started with puppet, you need to install Puppet in your workstation. If are running Debian
or Ubuntu you just need to run in your terminal `apt-get install puppet`, for other OS's please
refer to [Installing Puppet: Pre-Install Tasks](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/install_puppet/pre_install.html).

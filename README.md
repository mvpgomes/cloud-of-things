Cloud Of Things
===============

Cloud of Things is an infrastructure framework that provides storage and maintenance over
the objects that are present in a specific physical space.

A Cloud infrastructure is used to storage the objects that are present in the physical space.
In order to make the installation and configuration more efficient and simple we use Puppet
Enterprise to perform the IT automation.

Cloud of Things can be combined with many Cloud Service Providers, including [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/),
[Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) and [VMware](http://vmware.com). 

The instructions to configure and deploy this framework can differ
depending on the Clous Service Provider that you choose. You can find the instructions for
installation and configuration of Cloud Of Things in the `/puppet` folder.
